# Testline Quiz Assignment

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. I have listed required libraries in requirements.txt   
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Quiz_Data_Analysis.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab.
4. Run all cells sequentially to load the data, process it, and generate insights.

## Project Approach

The project begins by importing three datasets using API URLs:

- **Historical Quiz Data**: Contains detailed performance records from multiple quiz attempts.
- **Quiz Metadata**: Describes quiz topics and related parameters.
- **Latest Quiz Submission**: Provides data on the user's most recent quiz attempt.

**I have written my approach and insights in detail within the markdown sections of the notebook. Kindly refer to it for a comprehensive understanding.**

The project follows a four-step approach:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualization
4. Insights and Recommendations

## Output Files

- **Processed Historical Data**: Saved as `historical_quiz.csv`.
- **Processed Latest Quiz Submission**: Saved as `latest_quiz_submission.csv`.

## Notes

- The dataset used is relatively small. If required, I can automate the insights generation for a larger dataset.
- Machine learning models can also be leveraged for predictions and a recommendation system.
